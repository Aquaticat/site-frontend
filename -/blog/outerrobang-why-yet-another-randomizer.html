      <h2 class="h2">Because I need it.</h2>
      <p class="p">I usually need random numbers. Sometimes I use that for simulated data, sometimes for deciding which thing to do next.</p>
      <p class="p">When I'm tired of work but not wanting to take a rest, I get a random number between 0 and 1 from <a class="link link_theme_plain" href="https://www.random.org">RANDOM.ORG</a> and let it decide if I should continue to work or take a rest.</p>
      <p class="p">Recently RANDOM.ORG has not been working well for me. I am frequently asked to complete a Captcha but sometimes it doesn't even let me check the Captcha. (Rate limited) This seems to be a <a class="link link_theme_plain" href="https://www.hcaptcha.com">hCaptcha</a> problem.</p>
      <p class="p">Thus, this has been a painful experience for me. I know I could have tried other services, but I don't trust their random numbers as well as RANDOM.ORG's. Using command line seems to be a viable method, but I'd like to have a nice UI to work with. </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="h2">Because I want to pick up frontend web development.</h2>
      <p class="p">I read a little bit of <a class="link link_theme_plain" href="https://tkdocs.com/">Tk documentation (unofficial)</a>, I found it nice and easy to work with, thus initially, I decided to write it using Tk. However, I didn't go with that idea since I need to use the service on both my PC and my phone.</p>
      <p class="p">Although I haven't been doing frontend web development for about one year now, I decided to pick it up again. So I wrote this website (the one you are reading) to see how it goes.</p>
      <p class="p">Turns out it didn't go so well. I invested seven full days in total, but the result is just subpar, you can see. I should have read more materials before starting to write this website. That way I could have saved time and future maintenance efforts.</p>
      <p class="p">Anyways, I'm picking it up and looking forward to start working on <a class="link link_theme_plain" href="https://ou.terrobang.com">Ou.terrobang.com</a></p>
      <p class="p">Thanks for reading.</p>
